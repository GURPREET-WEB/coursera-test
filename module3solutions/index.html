Though there are a seemingly endless number of variations, most sushi is often considered to have a number of surprising health benefits.  Most importantly, always chew your food patiently. Do not just swallow it after chewing for four-five times. This way your food won’t get digested properly. Savor the food slowly and steadily.  It will improve the quality of your life and keep all the illnesses away.</p>
